                                Does not refer to reconcile compromise. We believe that all
                                the best centralized to the point, will be able to achieve a perfect balance. The player
                                superbly plays their instruments, the same pursuit of musical instruments, the
                                instrument also requires the player to reach perfection. The ideal goal of the player is
                                to promote the evolution of musical instruments catalyst. Similarly, the rapid
                                development of the instrument also can stimulate the creative passion of the players.

                                The violin, sometimes known as a fiddle, is a wooden string instrument in the violin
                                family. Most violins have a hollow wooden body. It is the smallest and highest-pitched
                                instrument (soprano) in the family in regular use. Smaller violin-type instruments
                                exist, including the violino piccolo and the pochette, but these are virtually unused.
                                The violin typically has four strings, usually tuned in perfect fifths with notes G3,
                                D4, A4, E5, and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings. It can also
                                be played by plucking the strings with the fingers (pizzicato) and, in specialized
                                cases, by striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow (col legno).

                                        The largest part of the violin is the hollow body. Its main function is to
                                        amplify the sound of the strings. The body is made up of the back, belly (top)
                                        and ribs (sides). The body is shaped like an hourglass.

                                        The neck is the long piece of wood that sticks out from the body. Glued on top
                                        of the neck is the fingerboard. This is a smooth flat piece of wood where the
                                        musician presses down on the strings to make notes. Unlike a guitar, the
                                        fingerboard on a violin is smooth and has no frets.

                                        Located above the neck, the pegbox is where the pegs are inserted and the
                                        strings are attached. The tightness and tuning of the strings are adjusted by
                                        the pegs in the pegbox.

                                        f-holes. These holes are where the sound of the violin comes out of the body.
                                        They are called f-holes because they resemble an f in italics. Changing the
                                        size, shape, and length of these holes can change the sounds of the violin.

                                        The bow of the violin is made up of the stick and the horse hair. The stick
                                        gives the bow strength and is where the violinist holds the bow. The horse hair
                                        is what is rubbed against the strings to make vibrations and sound. The horse
                                        hair connects to the stick at the frog on one end and the point on the other.
